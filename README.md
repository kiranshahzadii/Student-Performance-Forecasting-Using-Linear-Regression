# Student Performance Forecasting Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict student performance based on various academic parameters. It aims to provide insights into factors influencing student marks and create a tool for forecasting academic success.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Linear regression model implementation
- Performance evaluation and visualization
- Predictive analysis of student marks

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiranshahzadii/student-performance-forecasting.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd student-performance-forecasting
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Student_Performance_Forecasting.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis and prediction model.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing student information and academic performance metrics. The dataset includes features such as study time, previous grades, and attendance.

## Model
We use a linear regression model from scikit-learn to predict student marks based on the input features.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% in predicting student marks. Visualizations and detailed analysis can be found in the notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or extend the analysis are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
